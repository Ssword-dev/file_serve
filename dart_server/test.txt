The Chronicles of the Dustlands

In the farthest reaches of the known territories, beyond the fractured ridges of the Earthscar Plateau and the endless whispering dunes of the Wastrel Sands, lay a forgotten region known to only a few as the Dustlands. It was a place spoken of in brittle scrolls and half-remembered dreams, a place where time behaved strangely, and reality bent like heat-haze on obsidian rock. Travelers rarely ventured into the Dustlands, for the journey was long, the winds fierce, and the silence eternal.

The Dustlands had no kings, no cities, no banners flapping in the wind. What it had were remnants — broken pillars, sunken walls, rusted blades embedded in the ground like fossils of war. And above all else, it had the wind. The wind never stopped. It moaned across the sand, slithered between cracked stones, and spoke to those who dared to listen.

There are stories — endless stories — of what lies in the heart of the Dustlands. Some say a mirror-world exists there, a shadow twin of our realm where every lie is truth and every dream is memory. Others whisper of a tower, impossibly tall, that reaches into the firmament and below the crust of the world itself, built by an ancient civilization that wished to escape time altogether. Some believe the Dustlands are simply empty, a vast scar left behind by gods who turned their gaze elsewhere.

It was into this uncertain place that Rellon, a scholar-exile from the city of Valecrest, wandered with nothing but a compass, a half-empty canteen, and the bones of a forgotten language etched into wax tablets. Rellon did not seek glory or gold. He sought answers. He had once dreamed of the Dustlands as a child — not in vague shapes, but in crisp, vivid detail: a staircase descending into red sand; a door beneath a tree without roots; a song that played from the stars.

He had studied these dreams for decades, charted their patterns, measured their lunar correlations. Every piece of data pointed him here. The Dustlands were not just wasteland. They were a record — a chronicle written in geological time and mythological syntax.

For twenty-nine days, Rellon traversed the desert. His compass whirled wildly, pointing in no fixed direction. By the sixth day, the sun began to rise and fall irregularly. By the twelfth, shadows began moving on their own. Yet Rellon continued, trusting the voices he could no longer deny — voices that whispered in forgotten alphabets, speaking truths his waking mind could not understand.

On the thirtieth day, he found it: the staircase from his dreams.

It was half-buried, carved into a monolithic slab of black basalt, covered in glyphs that shimmered like fish scales in starlight. He descended, and with each step the wind grew silent, and the air warmer. At the base was a chamber, circular, with no doors and no ceiling — only sky. In the center stood a pedestal, upon which rested a sphere of obsidian, veined with red.

Rellon touched it.

He saw everything.

He saw the first words ever spoken — syllables that shaped continents. He saw wars fought with time itself, civilizations that only existed for a single second, preserved in amber loops of repeating chronology. He saw the Dustlands as they once were: a library the size of nations, where reality was written and rewritten by beings of language and fire.

When he returned, the desert had shifted.

He was not Rellon anymore. Or perhaps he always was. Time folds strangely in the Dustlands.

He wandered out again, whispering languages long dead, leaving trails of symbols wherever he walked. Some say these trails remain — that if you find one and follow it, the Dustlands will open again, and you too may see the chronicle.

But beware.

Once read, the Dustlands remember you too.
